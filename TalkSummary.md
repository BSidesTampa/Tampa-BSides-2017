The primary found will be a discussion around the application of accelerometer data for medical purposes and how those implications effect all users of devices with accelerometer capabilities. To frame the discussion, I will present findings produced using simple machine learning methods, building on prior research in academia. I will move on to explore the idea of "privacy by design" and how the goals of privacy align with security. Finally I will invite a discussion on how these implications can be applied to other contexts, and how professionals view privacy based on personal beliefs vs organizational needs. </td>

      <td>Nowadays,Information security especially Internet of "insecure" Things is becoming a more pressing concern.Connected devices and networks play an important role in every modern organization. But, if the organization does not properly test and secure their IoT solutions,Black hat Hackers or adversaries can compromise these solutions, damage business functionality, and steal data. Unfortunately, many organizations operate under the mistaken idea that a security scanner will reliably discover flaws in their systems.So effective cyber defense requires a realistic and thorough understanding of IoT security issues. Anyone can learn to sling a few web hacks, but effective penetration testing requires something deeper.Heathen Internet of Things Penetration Testing Framework developed to help developers and manufacturers build more secure products in the Internet of Things space based on the Open Web Application Security Project (OWASP) by providing a set of features in every fundamental era.(Insecure Web Interface ,Insecure Network Services ,Lack of Transport Encryption,Insecure Software/Firmware etc...) and taking MIRAI BOTNET as case study </td>

      <td>Your success as a professional in cybersecurity, audit, and risk professional depends on your ability to communicate effectively and influence people who may not report to you. You also have to stay up to speed with the latest regulations, threats, and technology. The challenge to inspire busy colleagues to cooperate and participate in the process to secure the organization is difficult. In fact, you are often accused of slowing down business workflows or holding up critical projects. The challenge is compounded with the outdated stereotypes and preconceptions that come with your technical title.

      <td>Since June of 2016, the world has been plagued by new variants of Locky ransomware that is based solely on JavaScript. This truly sucks because on Windows, JavaScript outside your browser runs in the Windows Script Host, which doesn't sandbox the script code; so it can do whatever it wants. Also, malware authors get access to already-built crypto APIs that makes their job much easier. This evolution has aided the spread of the malware even further than previously seen with other ransomware. In this talk, we will dissect the JS/Ransom-DDL malware and see how it works -- in terms of its installation, payload, command & control, encryption, obfuscation, etc., and even its evil attempt to install a secondary Trojan to steal passwords.  Finally, we will try to come up with some practical countermeasures to help thwart it and its variants in the future. </td>

      <td>Say incident response to 10 people and odds are you'll get 10 different opinions on how to do it right. It's become common knowledge that the best threat intel comes from inside an organization but what threat intel is important and what is simply noise? What is going to cause the adversary the most pain? In this talk we'll review common threat intelligence artifacts, where they come from and how to craft IOCs for maximum effect for your IR efforts </td>
