But, if the organization does not properly test and secure their IoT solutions,Black hat Hackers or adversaries can compromise these solutions, damage business functionality, and steal data. Unfortunately, many organizations operate under the mistaken idea that a security scanner will reliably discover flaws in their systems.So effective cyber defense requires a realistic and thorough understanding of IoT security issues. Anyone can learn to sling a few web hacks, but effective penetration testing requires something deeper.Heathen Internet of Things Penetration Testing Framework developed to help developers and manufacturers build more secure products in the Internet of Things space based on the Open Web Application Security Project (OWASP) by providing a set of features in every fundamental era.(Insecure Web Interface ,Insecure Network Services ,Lack of Transport Encryption,Insecure Software/Firmware etc...) and taking MIRAI BOTNET as case study </td>

      <td>Since June of 2016, the world has been plagued by new variants of Locky ransomware that is based solely on JavaScript. This truly sucks because on Windows, JavaScript outside your browser runs in the Windows Script Host, which doesn't sandbox the script code; so it can do whatever it wants. Also, malware authors get access to already-built crypto APIs that makes their job much easier. This evolution has aided the spread of the malware even further than previously seen with other ransomware. In this talk, we will dissect the JS/Ransom-DDL malware and see how it works -- in terms of its installation, payload, command & control, encryption, obfuscation, etc., and even its evil attempt to install a secondary Trojan to steal passwords.  Finally, we will try to come up with some practical countermeasures to help thwart it and its variants in the future. </td>

While most data security policies and practices today focus on primarily text- or document-based asset hardening and protection, visual assets (e.g. photographs) are often left vulnerable to adversarial data collection--to use a simple yet damaging example, can you imagine posting a photo of a location-sensitive data center only to forget to remove GPS coordinates from the image's metadata? What about a student ID number seen on an Instagram feed, which when coupled with photos of the same target's birthday party can be used to obtain their university credentials? Our talk will discuss various counter-forensic measures against both existent and emergent threats targeting image-centric intelligence gathering which adversaries may use to leverage target exploitation attacks. Specifically, the problem is as follows: visual assets can inadvertently leak valuable information which should be kept private. The target may either not realize that the particular information is being leaked, or may realize that it is being leaked but may not consider the fact that the leaked information should be kept private in th first place. Our presentation will explore the myriad ways that images may be mined for said information, and in turn offer counter-forensic techniques of preventing said data leakage by focusing on obfuscation, removal, and altercation of the leaked information. We have also written a detailed breakdown of the topics that will be discussed: - In detail, we will discuss the following six concentrated topics outlining both attack vectors and in turn presenting pertinent defense measures in the form of counter-forensic image sanitation techniques. The numbering is not directly representative of the number of accompanying slides, merely of the number of main focal points covered (e.g. point 3 may have 4 separate slides, etc.). 0. Introduction to Visual Data Extraction --A seemingly innocuous photograph will be displayed, and the audience will be asked to jot down a list of all potentially-identifiable information they can visually extract just by looking at the image. The same image will be returned to at the end of the talk and the same question will be asked. 1. The Risks of Latent Embedded Image Metadata --Prior to discussing overt (or readily visible) image data, we will undertake a discussion of latent (or not readily visible) image metadata, which is to say metadata. Various particularly sensitive Exif and PNG metadata fields will be explored (e.g. GPS coordinates, owner information such as name and serial numbers, time and timezone settings, and so on). Following the showing of how metadata can be viewed (via software such as Exiftool and browse extensions such as Exif Viewer), the talk will further discuss counter-forensic best practices of not merely wiping, but altering metadata. 2. Beyond GPS: Exploring Secondary Location Leaks --'OK, so you've removed GPS metadata from your photos, think you're safe?' Going beyond metadata, the discussion will now turn to overt visual cues which may alert adversaries as to the location and conditions an image was taken in. These techniques are explored and counter-measures presented to obfuscate the true location of sensitive images (for instance, by replacing the outlet plug covers in a data center prior to taking publicity photos to mask its actual geographic location; or leaving a Turkish newspaper on a table prior to taking a photo in an Australian hotel). 3. Proper Redaction Protocol --Now that we have identified some potentially-compromising visual information in images, what are the best practices for redacting or altering this information? Various novelty blurring filters afforded by high-end photo editing software may be reverse-engineered to reveal data thought to be redacted; for instance, blurred credit card numbers may potentially be reversed with high degrees of certainty if one can replicate the same font and font color. Thus, proper sanitation of critical image components is crucial. Here, we will discuss various redaction strategies, from avoiding blur and other novelty effects to falsifying the apparent scope of the redacted area. 4. Image-Based Privilege Escalation --So-called 'fusking' attack techniques and countermeasures are discussed, as image location enumeration may often lead to further sensitive images being discovered. Fusking attacks are predicated on standard camera vendor filename conventions and incremental numbering. The critical importance of filenaming and directory structuring when storing images is addressed. 5. Reverse Image Searching  --Reverse image search engines are next discussed, with an eye towards non-obvious uses. For instance, if one does a preemptive reverse image search on an image before placing it online to make sure it doesn't lead to a sensitive personal website and the search comes up with no hits, is it safe? What about if the image is cropped to remove extraneous data so that, for instance, it is now just a target's face? What if still frames from a video are fed into a reverse image search? 6. Social Media Mining --Ostensibly anonymous images may be traced back to the source and lead to enumeration of sensitive assets (e.g. deducing which location or position the subject of a photograph holds and who, in turn, belongs to their particular social network). Preemptive counter-forensic methods of foiling image-based social-media analysis are discussed such as tag obfuscation and avoidance. A hypothetical case study will be presenting of the amount of personally-identifiable information that may be extracted from following someone's social media feeds for a month (such as date of birth, ID numbers, social network, as well as past, present, and future locations). 7. Conclusion --Returning now to the image presented at the outset of the talk, we ask the audience to come up with a new list of information they could now potentially extract from the image, and compare it to the preliminary list they made.   </td>

No matter the skill level of participants, I want to make sure that beginners and more experienced participants leave with tools and resources they can use to continue learning.  If i were to give this presentation today the flow would be:  1) Introduction of speaker and language  2) Reference to resources I have found valuable  3) Examples: Lets do a pen test. How do we enumerate users/groups? Difference between remote WMI and WinRM. Ways of maintaining persistence ( Using the registry)  4) Defense side. How to stop Powerview, and Bloodhound. Logging and the various levels ( Transcription, script block logging, and event forwarding ) 5) Defense/offense: Overview of Powershell 5 features such as AMSI (Powershell's antivirus inspection), as well as constrained language mode.

First theorized by Socrates and further expanded by Tom Hobbes, John Locke and Jean-Jacques Rousseau, this system is so fundamental most people take part in it unwittingly. Social hackers can use this to their advantage - and by breaking the social contract, we are all left vulnerable to attack. In this talk I will discuss how social contracts develop and how hackers use this natural human behavior against their targets.  </td>
